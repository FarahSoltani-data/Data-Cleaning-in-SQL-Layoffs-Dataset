In this project, I performed data cleaning using SQL on a dataset from Kaggle that tracks layoffs in various industries.
The process involved:
_Creating a staging table to preserve raw data.
_Identifying and removing duplicates using SQL window functions.
_Standardizing and correcting data inconsistencies.
_Handling NULL values and making decisions on missing data.
_Eliminating unnecessary columns and rows to improve data quality.
This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL for data preprocessing, ensuring clean and reliable datasets for further analysis.
